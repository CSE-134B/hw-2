This homework presents an opportunity to try out the large number of tags supported in HTML5.
The HTML5 specification is a sprawling document that includes both tags and related APIs. 
Sections 3 and 4 of the specification cover the document and the various elements you may use. 
In order to gain some familiarity with the spec we want you to read it over and create simple example(s) 
that demonstrate every element in a valid way. Do understand we are not expecting every aspect of every 
element to be tested as that would take a prohibitive amount of time. We are expecting instead to develop 
an awareness of what element are available and how they might be used. To test the elements you will need
to make many different documents. We would warn against making an individual document per element given the
logistics of maintaining and linking all these files, but you will have to make copies in order to support grading. 
What we mean by this is that you may have demo that tests a number of tags like p, ul, li, etc. but you will have 
to have multiple copies named p.html, ul.html, etc. so that grading can be performed reasonably. 
Perform the file duplication at the end obviously. Put all your files in a folder called "tags" before you 
zip it up for turn in and make sure that you have a file for each tag in lower case. Also make sure you have an index.
html file in the directory that has a list with links of each tag as the grader will start there. The individual tags 
should be tested in a reasonably way so you are comfortable in their basic use and must be valid per the 
validator found at http://validator.w3.org. If you have any areas of unclarity provide a README.md file for the TA or grader.
Once you have completed your test cases view the tests in Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer and note non-supported 
elements or oddities you find. Summarize any issues you find in an HTML page named "conformance.html".

Finally make a team page (team.html) that lists all your team members, has a photo or avatar for each, 
contact information and maybe some introductory information about the goals or culture of your team. 
This page can be as creative as you like. You are allowed to use CSS if you want (though you won't be graded 
on it this exercise). You will have time on the next assignment to improve your team page so focus on markup 
quality and make sure it validates!
