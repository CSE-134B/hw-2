  <h1>Odditites and Non-Supported Elements</h1>
  <h2>Flow Content</h2>
  <p>In Internet Explorer, I get a warning that says: "Internet Explorer restricted this page from running scripts or ActiveX controls", which I do not get in any other of the browsers.  The meter element on Edge and Internet Explorer both show up as plain text: "# out of #", whereas on Chrome and Firefox it shows up as a graphical meter.  The keygen tag does not show up at all in Internet Explorer or Edge, but on Chrome it shows up as a select dropdown with both numbers and a description, while on Firefox it shows up as just the description.  The range input dynamically changes the content of the output on Chrome and Firefox, but does not on Edge and Internet Explorer.  Each range input looks a little different, and the one on Internet Explorer slides easier than the one on Edge. The progress bar looks a little different on each browser; except for Internet Explorer and Edge where they look the same.  All of them seem to work correctly.  The ruby tag looks similar on Edge, Internet Explorer, and Chrome, but looks different on Firefox.  On Firefox, the characters are more spread out instead of being on top of each other.</p>
  <h2>Interactive &amp; Embedded Content</h2>
  <p>While the interactive and embedded content tags were supported on Chrome and Safari, the PDF viewer and the controls for the audio and video player looked slightly different. In Chrome, the controls had rounded edges, while in Safari they were thinner and straight. Furthermore, the controls in Safari had a useful 30-second rewind button, which was lacking from Chrome. In other words, the control fields of the audio and video tags were affected.  The audio player on Internet Explorer says: "Error: Audio playback was aborted".  The HTML5 video players work similarly on all browsers except for Internet Explorer where it gives an error saying: "Aborted".  I also noticed that on Edge and Firefox, it shows the time duration of the video, whereas on Chrome it does not.  The button onclick redirect works on Edge, Chrome, and Firefox, but did not work on Internet Explorer.  The object element with the embedded pdf works on Edge, Firefox, and Chrome, but does not work on Internet Explorer.  Also there are no supplemental controls for Edge like there are on Firefox and Chrome.</p>
  <h2>Palpable Content</h2>
  <p>The page content was the same across Chrome and Safari as well as Firefox, Edge, and Internet Explorer, but the required inputs said "Please fill out this field" on Firefox and Chrome instead of: "This is a required field" on Edge and Internet Explorer.</p>
  <h2>Phrasing Content</h2>
  <p>The datalist element works similarly on all of the browsers, but on Edge and Internet Explorer, it gives you an "x" to delete the filled in content unlike Chrome and Firefox.  The scripting in Edge and Internet Explorer did not work correctly, while in Firefox and Chrome, it filled out the tables as intended.</p>
